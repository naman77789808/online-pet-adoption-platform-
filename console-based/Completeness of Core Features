To ensure completeness, we implement all required functionalities:

User Registration is fully functional.
Pet Adoption logic is implemented with available pets being displayed and updated after adoption.
User Profiles display the user's information and adopted pets.
Edge Cases such as adopting an unavailable pet or invalid user input are handled.
Example of Completeness:
User Registration: Users can register and are added to the system.
Pet Adoption: Users can adopt pets, and the system ensures pets are removed from the available list after adoption.
Profile Viewing: Users can view their details and adopted pets
