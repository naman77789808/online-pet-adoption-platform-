Good code should be readable, well-structured, and modular. This is accomplished by breaking down the program into smaller, manageable components and following clear naming conventions.

Example:
Classes: Separate classes for User, PetAdoptionSystem, and PetAdoptionApp keep responsibilities clear.
Methods: Each method has a single responsibility. For instance, registerUser() handles registration, adoptPet() handles the adoption logic, etc.
Clear Naming: Method and variable names clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., adoptPet, displayProfile).
